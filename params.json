{"name":"c3po","tagline":"Clever, Crafty Content Profiling of Objects","body":"[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/peshkira/c3po.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/peshkira/c3po)\r\n\r\nC3PO is a software tool, which uses meta data extracted from files of a digital collection as input to generate a profile of the content set.\r\nIt is designed in a way so that different meta data formats originating from different tools can be easily integrated. Currently it supports [FITS](https://github.com/harvard-lts/fits) meta data and [Apache TIKA](https://github.com/harvard-lts/fits) meta data.\r\n\r\nThe tool follows a three part profiling process and provides facilities for data export and further analysis of the content, such as helpful visualisations of the meta data characteristics, partitioning of the collection into homogeneous sets based on any known characteristic. For each chosen partition of the content, a special machine-readable profile can be generated that contains aggregations\r\nand distributions for many of the properties. The profile optionally contains the set of chosen sample objects that are representative.\r\n\r\nReleases\r\n------------------------\r\nPlease refer to [this](https://github.com/peshkira/c3po/wiki/Downloads)\r\n\r\nSetup\r\n------------------------\r\nPlease refer to [this](https://github.com/peshkira/c3po/wiki/Setup-Guide) guide.\r\n\r\nWant to contribute\r\n------------------------\r\nPlease refer to [this](https://github.com/peshkira/c3po/wiki/Development-Guide) guide.\r\n\r\nScreenshot\r\n------------------------\r\n![Collection Overview](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/8290338/blog/c3po_overview.png \"Collection Overview\")\r\n\r\nAdditional Information\r\n------------------------\r\nYou can find more information in the following links:\r\n- [Blog Post](http://www.openplanetsfoundation.org/blogs/2012-11-19-c3po-content-profiling-tool-preservation-analysis)\r\n- [Screencast](https://vimeo.com/53069664)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
