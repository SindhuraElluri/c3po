            <p>
              c3po is a content profiling tool used during preservation planning. It uses the meta data extracted from digital objects and aggregates it in order
              to support the analysis during preservation planning activities. Furthermore, c3po provides representative samples
              from collections based on different algorithms.
            </p>
            <p>
              It offers different data export facilities, so that planners can analyze the content even more and obtain deeper knowledge
              of the objects they are trying to preserve.
